# **EinR_CD05: Scientific Discovery with Quantum Computers**

This repository was written as a join effort between Aaron Chan and Justin Ely. Special thanks to Efekan Kokcu, Anupam Mitra, and Nischay Suri for guiding us through the math and science behind most of the topics in these notebooks, and for expanding our knowledge in the field of quantum computing. Thank you also to Bert de Jong for overseeing and aiding in the project.

This project was conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) as part of the Experiences in Research (EinR) program--a six-week program designed to introduce high schoolers to research through various topics in math, science, and management.

In the first four weeks of the project, we worked through all of the content in the folders marked Week 1, 2, and 3, which prepared us for our final project, which we spent the last two weeks on. Both of us learned a lot about quantum computing in these six weeks and we hope that any reader will learn a lot from these notebooks too.
